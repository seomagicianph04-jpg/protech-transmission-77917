The second time I told a friend who needed a transmission rebuild that Pro-Tech rebuilt my trans and it's been working fine. He was quoted a price for a full rebuild, so he took it in. Once they got the truck, they increased the price multiple times. Will never come back here, and you should save yourself the frustration.",

After thinking I got a bummer of a transmission rebuild come to find out it was my starter banging against the flex plate. After eating much crow, they said he could fix it and I told him that I wouldn't be able to pay for the work for 3 weeks. In return he offered to replace my starter to keep it from tearing up my truck and that I could pay him as soon as I could. Wow...... No other garage in town would have offered me the same deal after I ripped them a new one for no reason. For that I'm sorry. If you need work done call these guys. I will be taking my cars and trucks here for now on. Service is exceptional and I'm very pleased with them. 5 stars out of 5.",

Ray at Protech Transmission went above and beyond with kindness, professionalism, and quick action. He handled parts orders for my vehicle with speed and care, representing Protech with true excellence. The mechanics were outstanding—respectful, knowledgeable, and open to every question, even pointing out issues beyond the transmission that needed attention. Thanks to Ray and the entire team, my vehicle is back on the road. Highly recommend Protech Transmission for their top-notch service!

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been burned twice at this shop. The first was a shift kit install turned into an entire transmission rebuild. I didn't believe it, but went along for the ride. The second time I told a friend who needed a transmission rebuild that Pro-Tech rebuilt my trans and it's been working fine. He was quoted a price for a full rebuild, so he took it in. Once they got the truck, they increased the price multiple times. Will never come back here, and you should save yourself the frustration.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Had the manual transmission in my Toyota FJ Cruiser rebuilt by Pro Tech Transmissions — Ricardo, Ray, and Michael were professional, thorough, and experienced in transmission repair. I’d choose them over a Toyota dealer any day. Great work and fair pricing considering all parts were OEM from Toyota. I am hoping to get another 18 years out of my FJ thanks to their expertise!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">All I gotta say about this shop is wow. The owner, very stand up kinda guy. After thinking I got a bummer of a transmission rebuild come to find out it was my starter banging against the flex plate. After eating much crow, they said he could fix it and I told him that I wouldn't be able to pay for the work for 3 weeks. In return he offered to replace my starter to keep it from tearing up my truck and that I could pay him as soon as I could. Wow...... No other garage in town would have offered me the same deal after I ripped them a new one for no reason. For that I'm sorry. If you need work done call these guys. I will be taking my cars and trucks here for now on. Service is exceptional and I'm very pleased with them. 5 stars out of 5.</div>

Pro-Tech was very prompt in correcting the issues that someone else created. Needed service again several years later. This time they rebuilt the transmission themselves.  Vehicle runs like a champ and with a very fast turnaround time.</div>
